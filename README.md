# Boolean-Function-using-SystemVerilog
SystemVerilog code for the boolean function is given in Sampro.sv file y = a'b'c' + b'c' + a'c' + a'b'
Netlist.pdf file includes the Netlist diagram for the code showing the connection between the gates forming the boolean function y.
Sim.pdf shows the modelsim simulation result for different combination of inputs a, b, and c.
